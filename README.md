# sentimental_analysis
This project focuses on implementing a classifier using machine learning algorithms to extract sentiment of a personâ€™s thoughts. A major focus of this study was on comparing different machine learning algorithms based upon their performances. Also this approach allows to give a grade to the thoughts of person based upon their intended sentiments which belong to one of the classes namely: happy, sad, sob, scared, cheered. From the evaluation of this study, it can be concluded that the proposed machine learning techniques are effective and practical methods for sentiment analysis.
